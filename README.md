Project Description

Hello and welcome to my phase 1 project. This project uses JavaScript, Css and HTML to make a Reptile market. It then uses a json server to make the backend. You will be able to post your Reptile, the image, price, color, gender and description. When you post your Reptile image, price, color, gender and description it will then get added to the website.

The requirements for the project are 3 different types of event listeners and at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods.                                                 I am going to use the following:
